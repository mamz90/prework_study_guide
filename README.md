# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this study guid to show myself I could code and the importance each language has.
The project boosted by confidence significantly. 

The study tips in this guide will be a reminder for myself and others, of the key elements and rules required for each coding language and the roles they all play.

The study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS and Javascript.
